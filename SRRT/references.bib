	abstract = {A new and simple theory for radiation-induced segregation in concentrated alloys is presented. The coupling between defect fluxes and atom fluxes is accounted for by the concept of preferential migration of vacancies and interstitials via A-atoms or B-atoms in a binary A-B alloy. Similarly, atom fluxes are partitioned into those occurring via vacancies and via interstitials. This approach permits expression of the defect fluxes and atom fluxes in terms of partial diffusivity coeffi- cients and concentration gradients of defects and alloy components. The time and space dependence of the defect concen- trations and composition of a binary alloy is described by a set of three coupled partial differential equations containing four partial diffusivity coefficients, i.e., those of A-atoms and B-atoms diffusing via vacancies and via interstitials. The set of differential equations has been integrated for some model binary alloys with complete miscibility, utilizing the geometry of a thin foil. The sample calculations are in good qualitative agreement with the general features of radiation-induced segregation as deduced from experiments. The temperature, dose and dose-rate dependencies of segregation in concentrated alloys are found to be similar to those predicted by the Johnson-Lam model for dilute alloys.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that grain boundary (GB) is an effective sink to trap irradiation-induced defects. Introducing large densities of GBs becomes an effective strategy to enhance irradiation resistance. However, the nano-grained materials have poor stability under the extreme irradiation, and the effect of nano-GB characters on the irradiation sink strength is largely unknown. Here, the sink strength of nano-GB is quantitatively investigated in the nano-grained Cu and dilute Cu–W alloys with the average grain size ranging from ∼20 to ∼50 nm by ∼300 keV He ions irradiation at room temperature and 673 K. The irradiation induced void volume ratio, size and distribution are confirmed to strongly depend on the grain size and irradiation temperature. The nano-GBs with different characters, such as the misorientation and GB plane, have similar relative energy. The nano-GB sink strength is independent on the GB characters, deriving from the highly curved nano-GB plane having excess volume and energy. Combining with molecular dynamics simulations, we can conclude that nano-grain size is the most vital factor for the sink strength with respect to the GB characters. With the increase of temperature and the decrease of grain size, the stable nano-GBs exhibit a behavior of “ideal” defects sink due to their high volume ratio and the increased point defect recombination probability. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the nano-GB sink efficiency and offer a guidance for designing nano-grained structural materials with optimum anti-irradiation performance for future fusion reactors.}

abstract="Irradiation is a unique driver for microstructure evolution in nuclear materials. It produces high concentrations of point defects and extended defects that trigger the formation of microstructural features such as voids, bubbles, precipitates and dislocations agglomerates. The evolution of such features significantly impacts the properties of materials, thus requiring careful modeling. The phase-field method has demonstrated its capability of simulating microstructure evolution in nuclear materials. Although the method does not yield as of yet quantitative results in various aspects of microstructure evolution, the community is working with the premise that the method will be a standard predictive tool in the future. The objective of this chapter is thus to present a concise summary of the status of development of the phase field approach for nuclear materials applications, with a special focus on the quantitative results obtained by following this approach. The strengths and limitations of the application of phase-field modeling of microstructure evolution in nuclear materials are discussed, and a summary of possible future research directions is presented.",

	abstract = {A formal asymptotic analysis of two classes of phase field models for void growth and coarsening in irradiated solids has been performed to assess their sharp-interface kinetics. It was found that the sharp interface limit of type B models, which include only point defect concentrations as order parameters governed by Cahn-Hilliard equations, captures diffusion-controlled kinetics. It was also found that a type B model reduces to a generalized one-sided classical Stefan problem in the case of a high driving thermodynamic force associated with the void growth stage, while it reduces to a generalized one-sided Mullins-Sekerka problem when the driving force is low in the case of void coarsening. The latter case corresponds to the famous rate theory description of void growth. Type C models, which include point defect concentrations and a non-conserved order parameter to distinguish between the void and solid phases and employ coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, are shown to represent mixed diffusion and interfacial kinetics. In particular, the Allen-Cahn equation of model C reduces to an interfacial constitutive law representing the attachment and emission kinetics of point defects at the void surface. In the limit of a high driving force associated with the void growth stage, a type C model reduces to a generalized one-sided Stefan problem with kinetic drag. In the limit of low driving forces characterizing the void coarsening stage, however, the model reduces to a generalized one-sided Mullins-Sekerka problem with kinetic drag. The analysis presented here paves the way for constructing quantitative phase field models for the irradiation-driven nucleation and growth of voids in crystalline solids by matching these models to a recently developed sharp interface theory.},

Measurements from this study along with measurements from F e - 16Cr-24Ni, Fe-20Cr-24Ni, Fe-24Cr-24Ni, and Fe-24Cr-19Ni alloys irradiated with protons confirm that RIS is strongly dependent on the alloy composition. Trends in segregation behavior in Fe-base alloys are consistent with high temperature diffusion measurements, indicating that a vacancy mechanism is the most likely primary driving force for RIS in austenitic steels. The migration energy for Cr is shown to be larger than the migration energy of Fe. Segregation measurements in Ni-base alloys are not consistent with high temperature diffusion measurements, indicating that ordering forces may be significant in the segregation process. Comparison of model calculations to measured RIS data indicate that Fe, Cr, and Ni diffusivities are composition dependent. This dependence on alloy composition limits the predictive ability of simple models because of the need for separate diffusion parameters for every alloy composition.},

One aspect of the radiation response of Ni-base alloys to radiation that is not well understood is grain boundary segregation. In this work, three alloys, speciﬁcally Ni–18Cr, Ni–18Cr–9Fe, and Ni–18Cr–0.08P were given a series of thermal treatments and quenching to understand the development of thermal non-equilibrium segregation (TNES). Additionally, they were irradiated using 3.2 MeV protons at temperatures from 200 to 500 °C to doses up to 1 dpa. Grain boundary segregation was measured with Auger Electron Spectroscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Chromium enrichment due to TNES could be caused by interactions between Ni and Cr or by interactions with impurity elements such as B, C, or N. Under irradiation, the addition of iron to Ni–18Cr reduced the grain boundary chromium depletion, while the addition of phosphorous increased the grain boundary chromium depletion.},

An Arrhenius function ﬁt to these tracer diffusivities is then used in a rate theory model for radiation induced segregation, along with the experimentally measured vacancy diffusivities. It is predicted that interstitial diffusion has a tendency to cause Cr enrichment near grain boundaries, partially counterbalancing the tendency for vacancy diffusion to cause Cr depletion. This results in more mild Cr depletion than would result if only the vacancy diffusion were accounted for, in better agreement with experiment. This physical description of RIS in Ni–Cr alloys, which invokes the effects of both vacancy and interstitial diffusion, is distinct from the conventional description which accounts only for the effect of vacancy diffusion.},

In this study, a coupled experimental and modeling approach is used to understand the response of grain boundary character in a model Ni–5Cr alloy after high temperature heavy-ion irradiation. Radiation-induced segregation and void denuded zones were experimentally examined as a function of grain boundary character, while a kinetic rate theory model with grain boundary character boundary conditions was used to theoretically model Cr depletion in the alloy system. The results highlight major variations in the radiation response between the coherent and incoherent twin grain boundaries, but show limited disparity in defect sink strength between random low- and high-angle grain boundary regimes.},

abstract = {The evolution of dislocation loops in two types of modified 310S steel under proton irradiation are investigated with rate theory simulations. The growth of dislocation loops is promoted with the increase of irradiation dose and growth rate decreases at high dose, while the number density of the dislocation loops increases first with dose and then tends to be saturated gradually. At the initial stage of irradiation, large number of dislocation loops nucleate and the density increases rapidly. With the development of irradiation, the growth of dislocation loops gradually takes over. Simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental observations of transmission electron microscope. Present study shows that The irradiation resistance of Zr-added steel is slightly better than that of (Nb, Ta, W)-added steel, which may due to the smaller migration energy of interstitials and vacancies in Zr-added steel than that in the (Nb, Ta, W)-added one.}

Therefore, this study is an attempt to compare the calculation results of the Brailsford method and our newly proposed method (modified Brailsford method). newly proposed method explains irradiation creep by the stress-enhanced diffusivity rather than modified formation energy which is adopted in Brailsford method. To verify newly proposed method, simulations were conducted at two different temperature conditions: 673 K and 873 K, which represent the minimum and maximum conditions in a fast breeder reactor; at 673 K, the original Brailsford method lacked the ability to consider the stress effect, whilst the newly proposed method showed relatively good agreement with the experimental data. At 873 K, both methods showed a high dependency on hoops stress. Moreover, molecular dynamic method is adopted and compared to newly proposed method at 873 K. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the new method is that, depending on hoops stress, the creep rate shows the opposite behavior that of Brailsford method by dpa.}

abstract = {Harnessing modern parallel computing resources to achieve complex multiphysics simulations is a daunting task. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) aims to enable such development by providing simplified interfaces for specification of partial differential equations, boundary conditions, material properties, and all aspects of a simulation without the need to consider the parallel, adaptive, nonlinear, finite element solve that is handled internally. Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales. Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.}

abstract = {A surface coating using pure chromium has been proposed to increase the accident tolerance of Zircaloy cladding in pressurized water reactors. However, there is not much irradiation experience with Cr alloys and especially pure Cr. In the present study, pure chromium was irradiated with 5 MeV Fe ions to 50 peak dpa (displacements per atom) at temperatures of 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C. Then irradiation at the peak swelling temperature of 550 °C was conducted to 50, 100, 150 peak dpa. Swelling at 50 dpa was observed over the entire temperature range studied, 450–650 °C, but appeared to be decreasing strongly at the temperature boundaries of the experiment. After an initial transient of rapid swelling, chromium was observed to swell at a rate of ~0.03–0.04%/dpa (up to 120 local dpa), which is much lower than pure Fe at 0.2%/dpa. This low swelling rate was found to be relatively insensitive to dpa rate, which varied by a factor of ~2 over the depth of data collection. Swelling was observed to begin quickly with an incubation period less than 10 dpa. Self-organization in the form of void ordering was observed to be developing at 50 dpa, becoming better defined with increasing dose. The void alignment direction is determined to be the 〈111〉 axial direction.}

abstract = {We present an approach to determine the sensitivity of irradiation damage accumulation to the irradiation dose rate in polycrystalline systems, when the internal and boundary sink strengths are the only microstructural components affecting defect accumulation. A rate theory of defect removal is introduced, and suggests that the impact of the irradiation rate on damage accumulation depends on the ratio of internal sink strength to the grain boundary sink strength. The validity of the model is tested with two different methodologies: i) proton irradiation of coarse grain commercial alloy, Zircaloy-4 and ii) atomistic simulation of electron irradiation of nano-size pure zirconium. In case (i), the removal of defects at the grain boundary is negligible, and the sensitivity to irradiation rate is minimal. In case (ii), defect annihilation at the boundary dominates. In that scenario, if the grain boundary density increases by a factor n, the irradiation rate should increase by a factor n2 times in order to achieve equivalent steady state damage accumulation.}

Accelerator-based simulation of void swelling, however, introduces a number of neutron-atypical features which require careful data extraction and, in some cases, introduction of innovative irradiation techniques to alleviate these issues. We briefly summarize three such atypical features: defect imbalance effects, pulsed beam effects, and carbon contamination. The latter issue has just been recently recognized as being relevant to simulation of void swelling and is discussed here in greater detail. It is shown that carbon ions are entrained in the ion beam by Coulomb force drag and accelerated toward the target surface. Beam-contaminant interactions are modeled using molecular dynamics simulation. By applying a multiple beam deflection technique, carbon and other contaminants can be effectively filtered out, as demonstrated in an irradiation of HT-9 alloy by 3.5MeV Fe ions.}

abstract = {Heavy ion irradiations at high dose rates are often used to simulate slow and expensive neutron irradiation experiments. However, many differences in the resultant modes of damage arise due to unique aspects of heavy ion irradiation. One such difference was recently shown in pure iron to manifest itself as a double peak in void swelling, with both peaks located away from the region of highest displacement damage. In other cases involving a variety of ferritic alloys there is often only a single peak in swelling vs. depth that is located very near the ion-incident surface. We show that these behaviors arise due to a combination of two separate effects: 1) suppression of void swelling due to injected interstitials, and 2) preferential sinking of interstitials to the ion-incident surface, which are very sensitive to the irradiation temperature and displacement rate. Care should therefore be used in collection and interpretation of data from the depth range outside the Bragg peak of ion irradiation experiments, as it is shown to be more complex than previously envisioned.}

In the coarse-grained annealed variant, a peak swelling of ∼12% was observed closer to the specimen surface rather than at the depth of peak displacement damage. The forward shift in depth between peak swelling and peak dose is proposed to be a consequence of suppression of void nucleation by injected interstitials. The swelling behavior in the front portion of the ion range mirrors that of neutron-induced swelling in this steel, exhibiting significant curvature with increasing dose as the swelling rate approaches the terminal swelling rate of 1%/dpa. An ultrafine grain variant of this steel produced by severely plastic deformation exhibits a similar suppression of void nucleation in the injected interstitial region, but also shows a significantly extended transient regime, not reaching the terminal swelling rate by 60dpa.}

The experimental conditions are established so as to isolate the dependence of RIS on the experimental parameters: temperature, dose and bulk composition. RIS is measured at prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGBs) using the STEM-EDS technique. Chromium is found to enrich at PAGBs in all conditions with the exception being T91 irradiated to 3 dpa at 700°C. The magnitude of enrichment is small ({\textless}2 at\%). Minor elements Si, Ni, and Cu also enrich consistently. A bell-shaped temperature dependence of RIS is observed in all elements. The amount of Cr enrichment decreases as a function of increasing bulk Cr concentration. Lastly, it is found that the 9Cr model alloy reaches a steady-state Cr RIS behavior at approximately 7 dpa, while the T91 reaches what may be a steady state near 3 dpa, then the amount of enrichment decreases at 10 dpa.},

abstract = {U3Si2 is a candidate accident tolerant fuel (ATF) replacement for UO2. U3Si2’s high uranium density and high thermal conductivity are favorable properties in steady-state and accident conditions. Low power performance of this U3Si2-SiC concept fuel is compared to that of UO2-Zr4 fuels by implementing models that describe the properties of U3Si2 and SiC-SiC into Idaho National Laboratory's (INL) fuel performance code, BISON. Included in these material models is a thermal creep model for U3Si2 based on compressive creep data. The simulated results are in keeping with community knowledge that the U3Si2-SiC concept fuel may serve as a replacement for UO2-Zr4 fuels during steady-state operation, provided the mSiC layer remains under compression. Through a moderate power history and three 24-month fuel cycles, the mSiC layer remains under compressive stress through a burnup of 80 MWd/kgU. During low power operation, failure of the mSiC layer generally occurs prior to significant thermal creep in U3Si2. Generally, U3Si2 creep is temperature sensitive and of little importance at the temperatures and stresses simulated during steady operation and during fuel-to-cladding contact. A parameter variation study including 11,520 individual simulations with variations in nominal fuel thermal creep rate, cladding thermal conductivity, cladding irradiation creep and swelling, cladding gap size, and cladding thickness demonstrated that research priorities for this ATF should revolve around reducing cladding thickness as a means to minimize cladding failure. Generally, despite advances in SiC-SiC compliance, the brittle nature of mSiC excludes U3Si2-SiC for use where fuel cladding contact may occur.}

Extensive studies on radiation effects in materials in the past few decades show that, although nearly no materials are immune to radiation damage, the approaches of deliberate introduction of certain types of defects in materials before radiation are effective in mitigating radiation damage. Nanostructured materials with abundant internal defects have been extensively investigated for various applications. The field of radiation damage in nanostructured materials is an exciting and rapidly evolving arena, enriched with challenges and opportunities. In this review article, we summarize and analyze the current understandings on the influence of various types of internal defect sinks on reduction of radiation damage in primarily nanostructured metallic materials, and partially on nanoceramic materials. We also point out open questions and future directions that may significantly improve our fundamental understandings on radiation damage in nanomaterials. The integration of extensive research effort, resources and expertise in various fields may eventually lead to the design of advanced nanomaterials with unprecedented radiation tolerance.}

abstract  ="It has been shown that concentrated solid solution alloys possess unusual electronic{,} magnetic{,} transport{,} mechanical and radiation-resistant properties that are directly related to underlying chemical complexity. Because every atom experiences a different local atomic environment{,} the formation and migration energies of vacancies and interstitials in these alloys exhibit a distribution{,} rather than a single value as in a pure metal or dilute alloy. Using ab initio calculations based on density functional theory and special quasirandom structures{,} we have characterized the distribution of defect formation energy and migration barrier in four Ni-based solid-solution alloys: Ni0.5Co0.5{,} Ni0.5Fe0.5{,} Ni0.8Fe0.2{,} and Ni0.8Cr0.2. As defect formation energies in finite-size models depend sensitively on the elemental chemical potential{,} we have developed a computationally efficient method for determining it which takes into account the global composition and the local short-range order. In addition we have compared the results of our ab initio calculations to those obtained from available embedded atom method (EAM) potentials. Our results indicate that the defect formation and migration energies are closely related to the specific atoms in the structure{,} which further determines the elemental diffusion properties. Different EAM potentials yield different features of defect energetics in concentrated alloys{,} pointing to the need for additional potential development efforts in order to allow spatial and temporal scale-up of defect and simulations{,} beyond those accessible to ab initio methods."}
