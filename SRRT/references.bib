The level of agreement establishes for the first time the capability to tailor ion irradiation to emulate in-reactor radiation damage.}

The effects of the second phase (BeO) fraction and morphology, temperature, and interface thermal resistance were investigated. The model predicts that the continuous second phase configuration has a higher effective thermal conductivity than the dispersed second phase configuration for the same volume fraction and temperature. Companion experiments were conducted to validate the model predictions. It was demonstrated that accounting for the interface (Kapitza) thermal resistance is necessary to improve the model predictions.

abstract={A phase-field model was developed to simulate the high burn-up structure formation and evolution in UO2. The model takes into account the interfacial energies of grain boundaries and bubble surfaces, the strain energy associated with dislocations, and the chemical energy of gas atoms. This enables the model to simulate the formation and growth of sub-grains and bubbles in a self-consistent manner. The model results demonstrate strong effects of dislocation density (its magnitude and distribution), grain boundary energy, and bubble radius and number density on the formation of the sub-grains. For polycrystalline UO2, the model predicts the average size of the recrystallized grains to lie within the range of 0.3--0.5 {\textmu}m corresponding to a dislocation density range of {\$}{\$} {\backslash}rho = (2.5 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}15{\}} - 2.65 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}15{\}} ) {\backslash};{\{}{\backslash}text{\{}m{\}}{\}}^{\{} - 2{\}} {\$}{\$} or equivalent to 70--75 GWd/tHM burn-up.

abstract = {U3Si2 is a candidate accident tolerant fuel (ATF) replacement for UO2. U3Si2’s high uranium density and high thermal conductivity are favorable properties in steady-state and accident conditions. Low power performance of this U3Si2-SiC concept fuel is compared to that of UO2-Zr4 fuels by implementing models that describe the properties of U3Si2 and SiC-SiC into Idaho National Laboratory's (INL) fuel performance code, BISON. Included in these material models is a thermal creep model for U3Si2 based on compressive creep data. The simulated results are in keeping with community knowledge that the U3Si2-SiC concept fuel may serve as a replacement for UO2-Zr4 fuels during steady-state operation, provided the mSiC layer remains under compression. Through a moderate power history and three 24-month fuel cycles, the mSiC layer remains under compressive stress through a burnup of 80 MWd/kgU. During low power operation, failure of the mSiC layer generally occurs prior to significant thermal creep in U3Si2. Generally, U3Si2 creep is temperature sensitive and of little importance at the temperatures and stresses simulated during steady operation and during fuel-to-cladding contact. A parameter variation study including 11,520 individual simulations with variations in nominal fuel thermal creep rate, cladding thermal conductivity, cladding irradiation creep and swelling, cladding gap size, and cladding thickness demonstrated that research priorities for this ATF should revolve around reducing cladding thickness as a means to minimize cladding failure. Generally, despite advances in SiC-SiC compliance, the brittle nature of mSiC excludes U3Si2-SiC for use where fuel cladding contact may occur.}

However, the rate theory method has not been used to model the irradiation creep behavior of iron-based alloys exposed to a stress-applied environment. Therefore, this study is an attempt to compare the calculation results of the Brailsford method and our newly proposed method (modified Brailsford method). newly proposed method explains irradiation creep by the stress-enhanced diffusivity rather than modified formation energy which is adopted in Brailsford method. To verify newly proposed method, simulations were conducted at two different temperature conditions: 673 K and 873 K, which represent the minimum and maximum conditions in a fast breeder reactor; at 673 K, the original Brailsford method lacked the ability to consider the stress effect, whilst the newly proposed method showed relatively good agreement with the experimental data. At 873 K, both methods showed a high dependency on hoops stress. Moreover, molecular dynamic method is adopted and compared to newly proposed method at 873 K. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the new method is that, depending on hoops stress, the creep rate shows the opposite behavior that of Brailsford method by dpa.}

abstract = {We present an approach to determine the sensitivity of irradiation damage accumulation to the irradiation dose rate in polycrystalline systems, when the internal and boundary sink strengths are the only microstructural components affecting defect accumulation. A rate theory of defect removal is introduced, and suggests that the impact of the irradiation rate on damage accumulation depends on the ratio of internal sink strength to the grain boundary sink strength. The validity of the model is tested with two different methodologies: i) proton irradiation of coarse grain commercial alloy, Zircaloy-4 and ii) atomistic simulation of electron irradiation of nano-size pure zirconium. In case (i), the removal of defects at the grain boundary is negligible, and the sensitivity to irradiation rate is minimal. In case (ii), defect annihilation at the boundary dominates. In that scenario, if the grain boundary density increases by a factor n, the irradiation rate should increase by a factor n2 times in order to achieve equivalent steady state damage accumulation.}

The growth of dislocation loops is promoted with the increase of irradiation dose and growth rate decreases at high dose, while the number density of the dislocation loops increases first with dose and then tends to be saturated gradually. At the initial stage of irradiation, large number of dislocation loops nucleate and the density increases rapidly. With the development of irradiation, the growth of dislocation loops gradually takes over. Simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental observations of transmission electron microscope. Present study shows that The irradiation resistance of Zr-added steel is slightly better than that of (Nb, Ta, W)-added steel, which may due to the smaller migration energy of interstitials and vacancies in Zr-added steel than that in the (Nb, Ta, W)-added one.}

abstract = {Heavy ion irradiations at high dose rates are often used to simulate slow and expensive neutron irradiation experiments. However, many differences in the resultant modes of damage arise due to unique aspects of heavy ion irradiation. One such difference was recently shown in pure iron to manifest itself as a double peak in void swelling, with both peaks located away from the region of highest displacement damage. In other cases involving a variety of ferritic alloys there is often only a single peak in swelling vs. depth that is located very near the ion-incident surface. We show that these behaviors arise due to a combination of two separate effects: 1) suppression of void swelling due to injected interstitials, and 2) preferential sinking of interstitials to the ion-incident surface, which are very sensitive to the irradiation temperature and displacement rate. Care should therefore be used in collection and interpretation of data from the depth range outside the Bragg peak of ion irradiation experiments, as it is shown to be more complex than previously envisioned.}

Accelerator-based simulation of void swelling, however, introduces a number of neutron-atypical features which require careful data extraction and, in some cases, introduction of innovative irradiation techniques to alleviate these issues. We briefly summarize three such atypical features: defect imbalance effects, pulsed beam effects, and carbon contamination. The latter issue has just been recently recognized as being relevant to simulation of void swelling and is discussed here in greater detail. It is shown that carbon ions are entrained in the ion beam by Coulomb force drag and accelerated toward the target surface. Beam-contaminant interactions are modeled using molecular dynamics simulation. By applying a multiple beam deflection technique, carbon and other contaminants can be effectively filtered out, as demonstrated in an irradiation of HT-9 alloy by 3.5MeV Fe ions.}

abstract = {Two variants of AISI 304L stainless steel (SS) with different grain size distributions were ion irradiated at 500°C to a peak dose of ∼60dpa. In the coarse-grained annealed variant, a peak swelling of ∼12% was observed closer to the specimen surface rather than at the depth of peak displacement damage. The forward shift in depth between peak swelling and peak dose is proposed to be a consequence of suppression of void nucleation by injected interstitials. The swelling behavior in the front portion of the ion range mirrors that of neutron-induced swelling in this steel, exhibiting significant curvature with increasing dose as the swelling rate approaches the terminal swelling rate of 1%/dpa. An ultrafine grain variant of this steel produced by severely plastic deformation exhibits a similar suppression of void nucleation in the injected interstitial region, but also shows a significantly extended transient regime, not reaching the terminal swelling rate by 60dpa.}

abstract = {Materials subjected to high dose irradiation by energetic particles often experience severe damage in the form of drastic increase of defect density, and significant degradation of their mechanical and physical properties. Extensive studies on radiation effects in materials in the past few decades show that, although nearly no materials are immune to radiation damage, the approaches of deliberate introduction of certain types of defects in materials before radiation are effective in mitigating radiation damage. Nanostructured materials with abundant internal defects have been extensively investigated for various applications. The field of radiation damage in nanostructured materials is an exciting and rapidly evolving arena, enriched with challenges and opportunities. In this review article, we summarize and analyze the current understandings on the influence of various types of internal defect sinks on reduction of radiation damage in primarily nanostructured metallic materials, and partially on nanoceramic materials. We also point out open questions and future directions that may significantly improve our fundamental understandings on radiation damage in nanomaterials. The integration of extensive research effort, resources and expertise in various fields may eventually lead to the design of advanced nanomaterials with unprecedented radiation tolerance.}

abstract = {A surface coating using pure chromium has been proposed to increase the accident tolerance of Zircaloy cladding in pressurized water reactors. However, there is not much irradiation experience with Cr alloys and especially pure Cr. In the present study, pure chromium was irradiated with 5 MeV Fe ions to 50 peak dpa (displacements per atom) at temperatures of 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C. Then irradiation at the peak swelling temperature of 550 °C was conducted to 50, 100, 150 peak dpa. Swelling at 50 dpa was observed over the entire temperature range studied, 450–650 °C, but appeared to be decreasing strongly at the temperature boundaries of the experiment. After an initial transient of rapid swelling, chromium was observed to swell at a rate of ~0.03–0.04%/dpa (up to 120 local dpa), which is much lower than pure Fe at 0.2%/dpa. This low swelling rate was found to be relatively insensitive to dpa rate, which varied by a factor of ~2 over the depth of data collection. Swelling was observed to begin quickly with an incubation period less than 10 dpa. Self-organization in the form of void ordering was observed to be developing at 50 dpa, becoming better defined with increasing dose. The void alignment direction is determined to be the 〈111〉 axial direction.}

It produces high concentrations of point defects and extended defects that trigger the formation of microstructural features such as voids, bubbles, precipitates and dislocations agglomerates. The evolution of such features significantly impacts the properties of materials, thus requiring careful modeling. The phase-field method has demonstrated its capability of simulating microstructure evolution in nuclear materials. Although the method does not yield as of yet quantitative results in various aspects of microstructure evolution, the community is working with the premise that the method will be a standard predictive tool in the future. The objective of this chapter is thus to present a concise summary of the status of development of the phase field approach for nuclear materials applications, with a special focus on the quantitative results obtained by following this approach. The strengths and limitations of the application of phase-field modeling of microstructure evolution in nuclear materials are discussed, and a summary of possible future research directions is presented.",

Typical radiation-induced microstructures include faulted and perfect dislocation loops, network dislocations, stacking fault tetrahedra, cavities, precipitates, and crystalline-to-amorphous phase transitions. Examples are given for each of these microstructural features produced under irradiation. This chapter provides an overview of the key parameters that influence the microstructural evolution of irradiated materials (metallic and ceramic). Irradiation dose and temperature are the two most important extrinsic variables that influence microstructure evolution in irradiated materials. The primary knock-on atom energy may also strongly affect microstructural changes, including direct creation of defect clusters or amorphous regions. Additional variables of potential importance include crystal structure, atomic weight, atomic bonding, dose rate, proportion of ionizing to displacive radiation, and the concentration and distribution of solute atoms (including alloying additions, impurities, and nuclear transmutation products). Some of the key consequences of microstructural changes are briefly summarized, including amorphization, thermal and electrical conductivity degradation, low temperature radiation embrittlement, irradiation creep, irradiation growth, void swelling, and high temperature helium embrittlement.}

Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales. Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.}

In this study, a coupled experimental and modeling approach is used to understand the response of grain boundary character in a model Ni–5Cr alloy after high temperature heavy-ion irradiation. Radiation-induced segregation and void denuded zones were experimentally examined as a function of grain boundary character, while a kinetic rate theory model with grain boundary character boundary conditions was used to theoretically model Cr depletion in the alloy system. The results highlight major variations in the radiation response between the coherent and incoherent twin grain boundaries, but show limited disparity in defect sink strength between random low- and high-angle grain boundary regimes.},

One aspect of the radiation response of Ni-base alloys to radiation that is not well understood is grain boundary segregation. In this work, three alloys, speciﬁcally Ni–18Cr, Ni–18Cr–9Fe, and Ni–18Cr–0.08P were given a series of thermal treatments and quenching to understand the development of thermal non-equilibrium segregation (TNES). Additionally, they were irradiated using 3.2 MeV protons at temperatures from 200 to 500 °C to doses up to 1 dpa. Grain boundary segregation was measured with Auger Electron Spectroscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Chromium enrichment due to TNES could be caused by interactions between Ni and Cr or by interactions with impurity elements such as B, C, or N. Under irradiation, the addition of iron to Ni–18Cr reduced the grain boundary chromium depletion, while the addition of phosphorous increased the grain boundary chromium depletion.},

The modeling results are then used to determine the phenomenological coefﬁcient matrices and the tracer diffusion coefﬁcients for both vacancy and interstitial mediated diffusion. In addition to predicting diffusion coefﬁcients, this ab initio-based approach provides information typically inaccessible to experiments, including the different contributions to diffusion (e.g., electronic excitation effects), the species dependence of interstitial diffusion, and the deviations from Arrhenius-type relations, which are often used to describe and extrapolate experimental diffusion data. It is found that: (1) Cr is the fastest diffusing species in Ni by both vacancy and interstitial diffusion, followed by Fe and then Ni. The enhanced diffusivity of Cr is primarily due to differences in migration barriers and binding energies, not pre-exponential factors. (2) Fe and Cr solutes in Ni have weak interactions with vacancies but Cr solutes bind strongly to interstitial defects. (3) Cr exhibits non-Arrhenius behavior in both vacancy and interstitial mediated diffusion. (4) Temperature dependent electronic contributions have a signiﬁcant impact on the diffusion in some cases. (5) The vacancy diffusion mechanism in Ni–Cr changes as a function of temperature resulting in vacancy–solute drag below 460 K.},

Diffusion in dilute and concentrated alloys is highlighted, as are theories of RIS that include new ideas on diffusion of complexes involving coupling between ﬂuxes of point defects and of solute atoms. Many important experimental observations are presented, including up-to-date ﬁndings using atom-probe tomography, with special emphasis on solute segregation in austenitic and ferritic steels. Results from computational modeling and theory are also presented and discussed in light of experimental ﬁndings.

Qualitative model behavior is compared and contrasted with the physical mechanisms that underlie conventional RIS models, and the effects of Cr–Cr interstitial trapping and defect sink bias are investigated. It is concluded that: (1) the parameters required in this RIS model are too sensitive to be rigorously determined by present DFT approaches alone, and ﬁtting to experimental RIS data is necessary to produce an accurate model. (2) In contrast with the emphasis of previous RIS models, the best ﬁt DFT-based RIS model suggests that under radiation, the interstitial ﬂux should drive Cr strongly toward enrichment near defect sinks, while the vacancy ﬂux should drive Cr strongly toward depletion, and that the vacancy effect should be slightly stronger resulting in moderate Cr depletion.

	abstract = {Two types of materials are selected by the nuclear industry to be used in nuclear reactors: either materials having specific nuclear properties, or standard engineering alloys corresponding to the thermomechanical loadings and environment.The first class corresponds to the fuels neutron absorbing isotopes or alloys of low neutron capture cross sections. These atomic properties do not preclude the chemical state of the species, and the best chemical state could be selected (e.g., B, a neutron absorber, can be used in water solution as boric acid or as refractory carbide: B4C). The second class corresponds to alloys, such as structural steels, stainless steels (SS), aluminum alloys, etc. Few specific alloys have been developed for particular applications, such as Zr alloys in water reactors or vanadium alloys in fusion devices.All these materials have to support the environment of a nuclear reactor. In addition to standard engineering constrains (mechanical loadings, corrosion, high temperatures, etc.), the irradiation itself induces major changes in structure, properties, and behavior of all the materials.Irradiation damage includes chemical changes induced by irradiation, with the specificity of in situ He formation, by (n, α) reactions, promoting swelling. However, the major mechanism of irradiation damage is mostly due to elastic interaction of neutrons with the atoms, leading to displacement cascades and generation of point defects (PD). The migration and clustering of these PD induce major changes in microstructure with corresponding changes in behavior.Irradiation hardening, reduction of ductility, irradiation creep and growth, and swelling are described in detail in their physical mechanisms and their specific characteristics for the alloys and ceramics for current use and of future interest. Other irradiation effects such as radiolysis on water, or changes in electrical properties of insulating ceramics are also described.After a generic description of the physics of the transformations induced in the microstructures by irradiation, the phenomena of major concern are presented for the different components of various reactors. The corresponding conditions are analyzed for various types of experimental reactors, power reactors (thermal and breeder), and fusion devices.},

A simple rate equation model with modi®ed boundary conditions, which included the ¯uxes of defects diusing along the grain boundaries to the grain boundary dislocations, was developed for RIS at boundaries with dierent R values. The results of the model calculations were compared to the experimental results previously reported by us. It was found that the model could clearly predict the same trends that the Cr depletion levels at special boundaries in irradiated 304 stainless steels were increasing with R. The model calculations also showed that the widths of the segregation cusps was decreasing with increasing R. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The helium concentration proﬁle was designed so to follow the damage curve with a 0.22 appm He/dpa ratio at the depth from 300 to 1000 nm in the material. The depth-dependence of the cavity size and number density were characterized by both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging methods. A comparison between the two techniques was done showing good agreement. Cavity number density and the resulting swelling were found to be suppressed by the injected interstitial eﬀect in the vicinity of the ion induced damage peak. The region between 300 and 750 nm depth which excludes the injected interstitial eﬀect was thus proposed for improved cavity swelling analysis. The swelling ratio in this region was found to be {\textasciitilde}(0.86–1.02) × 10− 2\%/dpa. In addition, ChemiSTEM characterization revealed radiation-induced segregation occurring throughout the irradiated region and precipitation of G-phase particles. Segregation of Ni to cavity surfaces was also observed and its possible synergistic inﬂuence on swelling was discussed.},

Although it is known these alloys exhibit radiation-induced segregation (RIS) at grain boundaries (GBs) while in-service, little is known about the mechanism behind RIS in F/M steels. The classical understanding of RIS in F/M steels presents a mechanism where point defects migrate to GBs acting as perfect sinks. However, variation in grain boundary structure may influence the sink efficiency and these migration processes. A proton irradiated 9wt.\% Cr model alloy steel was investigated using STEM/EDS spectrum imaging and GB misorientation analysis to determine the role of GB structure on RIS at different GBs. An ab initio based rate theory model was developed and compared to the experimental findings. This investigation found Cr preferentially segregates to specific GB structures. The preferential segregation to specific GB structures suggests GB structure plays a key role in the mechanism behind radiation-induced segregation, showing that not all grain boundaries in F/M steels act as perfect sinks. The study also found how irradiation dose and temperature impact the radiation-induced segregation response in F/M steels.},

Next, five applications of phase field modeling are discussed: precipitate evolution, grain growth, solidification, phase separation in battery electrodes, and deposition. Common approaches for using phase field modeling is described for each application, and recent progress is reviewed. The chapter then discusses recent developments in open-source computational frameworks for phase field modeling and the ways in which this new paradigm can broaden the application of microstructural modeling in materials research and development and improve the transparency of such work.

Experimental results and model predictions were in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with regard to the temperature dependence of segregation and the crossover from Cr enrichment to Cr depletion. The inverse Kirkendall mechanism was also in agreement with experimental ﬁndings that observed a decreasing amount of Cr enrichment with increasing bulk Cr composition.

	abstract = {A formal asymptotic analysis of two classes of phase field models for void growth and coarsening in irradiated solids has been performed to assess their sharp-interface kinetics. It was found that the sharp interface limit of type B models, which include only point defect concentrations as order parameters governed by Cahn-Hilliard equations, captures diffusion-controlled kinetics. It was also found that a type B model reduces to a generalized one-sided classical Stefan problem in the case of a high driving thermodynamic force associated with the void growth stage, while it reduces to a generalized one-sided Mullins-Sekerka problem when the driving force is low in the case of void coarsening. The latter case corresponds to the famous rate theory description of void growth. Type C models, which include point defect concentrations and a non-conserved order parameter to distinguish between the void and solid phases and employ coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, are shown to represent mixed diffusion and interfacial kinetics. In particular, the Allen-Cahn equation of model C reduces to an interfacial constitutive law representing the attachment and emission kinetics of point defects at the void surface. In the limit of a high driving force associated with the void growth stage, a type C model reduces to a generalized one-sided Stefan problem with kinetic drag. In the limit of low driving forces characterizing the void coarsening stage, however, the model reduces to a generalized one-sided Mullins-Sekerka problem with kinetic drag. The analysis presented here paves the way for constructing quantitative phase field models for the irradiation-driven nucleation and growth of voids in crystalline solids by matching these models to a recently developed sharp interface theory.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this thesis is to broaden the tools and knowledge available for understanding the behavior of metals under irradiation to aid in the pursuit of advanced materials for deployment in Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear reactor designs. A meanfield study is conducted on a body-centered cubic (BCC) A-B binary metal alloy system. The performance of the simulated metal system is measured by assessing the degree of segregation that occurs at the grain boundary (GB) in the center of the one-dimensional simulation box. This mean-field method was developed using rate theory equations to observe the diffusion of defects and solute atoms in the binary BCC alloy modeled after a section of planes in the {\textless}100{\textgreater} direction of α-iron. The method in this thesis is adapted from a previous radiation-induced segregation (RIS) study that was similarly validated against thermal segregation isotherms. This adapted simulation code was used to study RIS by varying the initial values and conditions across ranges relevant to Generation IV reactor designs. The simulations run with this code were centered around segregation energy and the diffusion coefficient relationships between defects and solute atoms. The most influential conditions applied to both the segregation energy and diffusion coefficient relationship test suites were the temperature and dose rate. The interplay of the various segregation energies, manipulated diffusion coefficients, temperatures, and dose rates is explored in this thesis. The code used in this thesis is presented as a modular framework for further parameter study with a clear direction for more complex alloys.},

The parameters of the diffusion model are fitted to DFT calculations. Transport coefficients that control the coupling between diffusion of defects and chemical species are measured in dilute and concentrated alloys. Radiation induced segregation near grain boundaries is directly simulated with this model. We find that the diffusion of vacancies toward sinks leads to a Cr depletion. Meanwhile, the diffusion of self-interstitials causes an enrichment of Cr in the vicinity of sinks. For concentrations lower than 15\%Cr, we predict that sinks will be enriched with Cr for temperatures lower than a threshold. When the temperature is above this threshold value, the sinks will be depleted in Cr. These results are compared to previous experimental studies and models. Cases of radiation induced precipitation and radiation accelerated precipitation are considered.},

Ab initio based modeling shows that the inverse Kirkendall mechanism for Cr in austenitic Ni-based systems is consistent with the observed Cr depletion, but that the result may be a balance of significant contributions from both vacancy and interstitial fluxes. In the F–M alloy system Kinetic Lattice Monte Carlo (KLMC) simulations of Cr segregation show that depending on the binding and diffusion energetics of Cr with vacancies, Cr diffusion by a vacancy mechanism can be either faster or slower than Fe. Experimental results show that RIS depends on the alloy composition and irradiation temperature, with grain boundary Cr enrichment occurring in the alloy with lower Cr (T91) and at lower temperature (400°C), and depletion occurring in higher Cr alloys (HT9 and HCM12A) and at higher irradiation temperature (500°C). Modeling results are entirely consistent with the expectations of an inverse Kirkendall mechanism determined by the relative rate of Cr to Fe diffusion.},

The model allows a single set of input parameters to describe a range of bulk alloy compositions. Comparisons of RIS measurements in austenitic Fe–Cr–Ni alloys with calculations using an inverse Kirkendall model have shown that composition specific diffusion parameters must be used to accurately predict segregation behavior, thus limiting the model's predictive capability when no prior segregation measurements exist. This paper describes the improved model and compares model calculations to segregation data from seven alloys irradiated at temperatures between 200 and 600°C and to doses from 0.1 to 3.0dpa. Results show that the dose, temperature and composition dependence of the measured segregation data can be modeled using a single set of input parameters with no error greater than 5at.\%, but usually less than 2at.\%.},

Because every atom experiences a different local atomic environment{,} the formation and migration energies of vacancies and interstitials in these alloys exhibit a distribution{,} rather than a single value as in a pure metal or dilute alloy. Using ab initio calculations based on density functional theory and special quasirandom structures{,} we have characterized the distribution of defect formation energy and migration barrier in four Ni-based solid-solution alloys: Ni0.5Co0.5{,} Ni0.5Fe0.5{,} Ni0.8Fe0.2{,} and Ni0.8Cr0.2. As defect formation energies in finite-size models depend sensitively on the elemental chemical potential{,} we have developed a computationally efficient method for determining it which takes into account the global composition and the local short-range order. In addition we have compared the results of our ab initio calculations to those obtained from available embedded atom method (EAM) potentials. Our results indicate that the defect formation and migration energies are closely related to the specific atoms in the structure{,} which further determines the elemental diffusion properties. Different EAM potentials yield different features of defect energetics in concentrated alloys{,} pointing to the need for additional potential development efforts in order to allow spatial and temporal scale-up of defect and simulations{,} beyond those accessible to ab initio methods."}

A phase-field model is developed to simulate void formation near different types of GBs. The sink term representing the annihilation of GB is modified by taking into account of the inclination angle for Σ GB and the defect mobility. The temperature-dependent material parameters of copper are derived from ab initio calculations. According to the numerical simulations, the boundaries of VDZs tend to move towards the interior grains with increasing the efficiency of GB sink term.

Diffusion in dilute and concentrated alloys is highlighted, as are theories of RIS that include new ideas on diffusion of complexes involving coupling between fluxes of point defects and of solute atoms. Many important experimental observations are presented, including up-to-date findings using atom-probe tomography, with special emphasis on solute segregation in austenitic and ferritic steels.

	abstract = {A systematic approach to measuring radiation-induced segregation (RIS) was used on four ferritic-martensitic (F-M) alloys: T91, HCM12A, HT9, and a Fe-9Cr model alloy, irradiated with 2.0 MeV protons over a range of doses (1-10 dpa) and temperatures (300-700°C). The experimental conditions are established so as to isolate the dependence of RIS on the experimental parameters: temperature, dose and bulk composition. RIS is measured at prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGBs) using the STEM-EDS technique. Chromium is found to enrich at PAGBs in all conditions with the exception being T91 irradiated to 3 dpa at 700°C. The magnitude of enrichment is small ({\textless}2 at\%). Minor elements Si, Ni, and Cu also enrich consistently. A bell-shaped temperature dependence of RIS is observed in all elements. The amount of Cr enrichment decreases as a function of increasing bulk Cr concentration. Lastly, it is found that the 9Cr model alloy reaches a steady-state Cr RIS behavior at approximately 7 dpa, while the T91 reaches what may be a steady state near 3 dpa, then the amount of enrichment decreases at 10 dpa.},

RIS manifests itself in several different ways, including diffusion to point-defect sinks (dislocations, grain boundaries, voids, etc.), which can induce precipitation in undersaturated alloys, as well as self-organization of solute clusters and precipitation in defect-free material. Diffusion in dilute and concentrated alloys is highlighted, as are theories of RIS that include new ideas on diffusion of complexes involving coupling between fluxes of point defects and of solute atoms. Many important experimental observations are presented, including up-to-date findings using atom-probe tomography, with special emphasis on solute segregation in austenitic and ferritic steels. Results from computational modeling and theory are also presented and discussed in light of experimental findings. Examples illustrating the factors affecting RIS are shown and some important outstanding issues that impact the current understanding of RIS are described and discussed.},

In particular, the dependence of segregation on temperature and grain boundary misorientation angle was analyzed. It is found that Cr enriches at grain boundaries at low temperatures primarily through the interstitialcy mechanism while depletes at high temperatures predominantly through the vacancy mechanism. There is a crossover from Cr enrichment to depletion at an intermediate temperature where the Cr:Fe vacancy and interstitialcy diffusion coefﬁcient ratios intersect. The bell-shape Cr enrichment response is attributed to the decreasing void sinks inside the grains as temperature rises. It is also shown that low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and special S coincidence-site lattice (CSL) grain boundaries exhibit suppressed radiation induced segregation (RIS) response while high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) have high RIS segregation. This different behavior is attributed to the variations in dislocation density at different grain boundaries.},

Here, we have studied the evolution of visible defect clusters in nanometer-thick molybdenum foils under 1MeV krypton ion irradiation at 80°C through both cluster dynamics modeling and in situ TEM experiments. The experimental details are reported elsewhere; we focus here on the details of model construction and comparing the model with the experiments. The model incorporates continuous production of point defects and/or small clusters, and the accompanying interactions, which include clustering, recombination and loss to the surfaces that result from the diffusion of the mobile defects. To account for the strong surface effect in thin TEM foils, the model includes one-dimensional spatial dependence along the foil depth, and explicitly treats the surfaces as black sinks. The rich amount of data (cluster number density and size distribution at a variety of foil thickness, irradiation dose and dose rate) offered by the advanced in situ experiments has allowed close comparisons with computer modeling and permitted significant validation and optimization of the model in terms of both physical model construct (damage production mode, identities of mobile defects) and parameterization (diffusivities of mobile defects). The optimized model exhibits good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the in situ TEM experiments. The combinatorial approach is expected to bring a unique opportunity for the study of radiation damage in structural materials.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this thesis is to broaden the tools and knowledge available for understanding the behavior of metals under irradiation to aid in the pursuit of advanced materials for deployment in Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear reactor designs. A meanfield study is conducted on a body-centered cubic (BCC) A-B binary metal alloy system. The performance of the simulated metal system is measured by assessing the degree of segregation that occurs at the grain boundary (GB) in the center of the one-dimensional simulation box. This mean-field method was developed using rate theory equations to observe the diffusion of defects and solute atoms in the binary BCC alloy modeled after a section of planes in the {\textless}100{\textgreater} direction of α-iron. The method in this thesis is adapted from a previous radiation-induced segregation (RIS) study that was similarly validated against thermal segregation isotherms. This adapted simulation code was used to study RIS by varying the initial values and conditions across ranges relevant to Generation IV reactor designs. The simulations run with this code were centered around segregation energy and the diffusion coefficient relationships between defects and solute atoms. The most influential conditions applied to both the segregation energy and diffusion coefficient relationship test suites were the temperature and dose rate. The interplay of the various segregation energies, manipulated diffusion coefficients, temperatures, and dose rates is explored in this thesis. The code used in this thesis is presented as a modular framework for further parameter study with a clear direction for more complex alloys.},

We prepared Fe–Cr model alloys with different Cr contents which were irradiated with 2MeV-electrons at the JAEA accelerator at Takasaki in Japan. The production of vacancy-type defects was verified by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The average positron lifetimes of the irradiated samples were increased by about 14\% when compared to the unirradiated one. The ratio curves, derived from a Doppler broadening measurement, did not reveal a prominent change between the irradiated pure Fe and Fe–Cr alloys, which implies that there was no formation of a vacancy-Cr complex. We performed computer simulations by using the Metropolis Monte Carlo method to predict a possible microstructure composed of Cr and vacancies. As expected, the simulation also revealed that no vacancy-Cr complexes were formed. Both results support a small amount of radiation-induced swelling in the Fe–Cr alloys.},

The results are in good agreement with available experimental observations of neutron irradiation at 290 °C. The irradiation is found to accelerate the kinetics of phase separation by orders of magnitude, with an acceleration factor given by the increase in point defect concentrations. The microstructure evolution is qualitatively the same as during isothermal annealing, except in the vicinity of point defect sinks. The effects of equilibrium and radiation induced segregations at grain boundaries are considered. The ballistic mixing occurring in displacement cascades is modeled, and is found to be insufficient to produce the dissolution of chromium rich precipitates at 290 °C, even at high dose rates.

The coupling between defect fluxes and atom fluxes is accounted for by the concept of preferential migration of vacancies and interstitials via A-atoms or B-atoms in a binary A-B alloy. Similarly, atom fluxes are partitioned into those occurring via vacancies and via interstitials. This approach permits expression of the defect fluxes and atom fluxes in terms of partial diffusivity coeffi- cients and concentration gradients of defects and alloy components. The time and space dependence of the defect concen- trations and composition of a binary alloy is described by a set of three coupled partial differential equations containing four partial diffusivity coefficients, i.e., those of A-atoms and B-atoms diffusing via vacancies and via interstitials. The set of differential equations has been integrated for some model binary alloys with complete miscibility, utilizing the geometry of a thin foil. The sample calculations are in good qualitative agreement with the general features of radiation-induced segregation as deduced from experiments. The temperature, dose and dose-rate dependencies of segregation in concentrated alloys are found to be similar to those predicted by the Johnson-Lam model for dilute alloys.},

The IK model reproduced the temperature dependence of proton and Fe++ ion irradiations, as well as the composition dependence of proton irradiations. The temperature dependence of Cr RIS is attributed to the dominance of Cr depletion by the vacancy mechanism at high temperatures, and Cr enrichment by interstitials at low temperatures. Cr enrichment changes to Cr depletion at the temperature where the Cr:Fe vacancy and interstitial diffusion coefficient ratios cross one another. Model results also showed a decrease in grain boundary Cr enrichment with bulk Cr concentration, in agreement with experimental results from T91, HCM12A, and HT9 following proton irradiation at 400°C. The IK model did not account for the experimentally observed dose dependence. This dose dependence of RIS was attributed to the complex microstructural evolution, which is not accounted for in the IK model.},

The diffusion flux equations were based on the Perks model formulated through the linear theory of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The preferential atom-vacancy coupling was described by the mobility model, whereas the preferential atom-interstitial coupling was described by the interstitial binding model. The composition dependence of the thermodynamic factor was modeled using the CALPHAD approach. The calculated fluxes up to 10 dpa suggested the dominant diffusion mechanism for chromium and iron is via vacancy, while that for nickel can swing from the vacancy to the interstitial dominant mechanism. The diffusion flux in the vicinity of a grain boundary was found to be greatly modified by the segregation induced by irradiation, leading to the oscillatory behavior of alloy compositions in this region.},

By considering the grain boundary as a distinguishable phase and adopting a “segregation potential” in the grain boundary region, the effect of solute drag is automatically incorporated into the model. It is shown at equilibrium that the model can reproduce the equilibrium solute segregation and Gibbs adsorption. It is also demonstrated at a one-dimensional steady state that the model includes both the solute drag proposed by Cahn and the free energy dissipation by Hillert and Sundman. In the dilute solution limit, the simple expressions for the concentration distribution around the interfacial region and the solute drag are obtained as functions of boundary velocity, diffusivity and segregation potential and they are found to be consistent with the previous theories for solute drag phenomenon. In two-dimensional quasi steady state, the phase ﬁeld model reduces to the relationship between normal velocity and the curvature of the boundary and the relationship between phase ﬁeld mobility and the grain boundary mobility is obtained.  2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

	abstract = {A number of experimental and theoretical findings in age hardening alloys suggest that specific solute elements preferentially segregate to and reduce the energy of the interphase boundary (IB). This segregation mechanism can stabilize the precipitation microstructure against coarsening, allowing higher operating temperatures in structural applications. Herein, we present a phase field model of solute segregation to IBs that separate matrix and precipitate phases in binary alloys. The proposed modeling framework is capable of capturing bulk thermodynamics and interfacial free energies, while also accounting for various mass transport mechanisms. Analytical equilibrium solutions of one-dimensional systems are presented, and excess IB quantities are evaluated independent of the Gibbs dividing surface convention. With the aid of the parallel tangent construction, IB segregation isotherms are established in terms of the alloy composition and the model parameters describing the free energy functions. Under the regular solution approximation, computational studies elucidating the dependence of the IB energy and segregation levels on temperature and free energy model parameters are presented. We show that the model is consistent with the Gibbs adsorption equation; therefore, it is possible to compare the adsorption behavior predicted by the model parameters with experiments and atomistic simulations. Future work on extending the model to ternary alloys, and incorporating the effect of elastic interactions on IB segregation is expected.},

A new formalism has been developed to allow for the application of an external driving pressure for the growth of one grain.

A non-linear relation between the driving force (curvature) and the GB velocity is found in two cases: (1) the GB motion undergoes a transition from the low-velocity extreme to the high-velocity extreme; (2) the GB migrates slowly in a strongly segregating system. The ﬁrst case is consistent with the solute drag theory of Cahn. As for the second case, which is unexpected according to solute drag theory, the non-linear relation between the GB velocity and curvature comes from two sources: the non-linear relation of the solute drag force with GB velocity, and the variation in GB energy with curvature. It is also found that, when the diﬀusivity is spatially inhomogeneous, the kinetics of GB motion is diﬀerent from that with a constant diﬀusivity.},

	abstract = {Impurity atoms segregated in grain boundary (GB) regions can dramatically change the physical and chemical properties of the GBs. Such changes often appear to be attributed to the GB energy reduction and/or solute drag effect. Phase-field models have been utilized to clarify both the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of the GB segregation. In this study, we developed phase-field models for GB segregation that are diffuse interface versions of the classical two-phase model of GB segregation. The thermodynamic state at any point in the system is represented as a mixture of a GB phase and a matrix phase. There are two choices for the thermodynamic relation between the GB phase and the matrix phase that constitute the point: the equal composition condition in model I and the equal diffusion potential condition in model II. Most of the previous PFMs for GB segregation appear to be specific cases of model I. We examined the thermodynamic properties of models I and II, and compared them with each other and the classical two-phase model. Although all the models resulted in the same GB composition, the GB energy and its dependency on the composition at the equilibrium state are quite different from each other. In model I, there is a lower bound to the GB energy, which originates from the equal composition condition. The GB energy from model II shows no such lower bound, and it is represented as the vertical distance between the parallel tangent lines on the free energy diagram, as in the classical two-phase model. Nevertheless, the compositional dependence in the model II is quite different from that in the classical two-phase model. This originates from the different choices for the composition-independent parameter in the models: a constant gradient energy coefficient in model II and a constant GB width in the classical two-phase model. Model I is not suitable for simulations of alloys that show a reduction of the GB energy due to GB segregation below a certain limit (in dilute alloys, about half of the GB energy of pure solvents). Model II is a correct choice for such alloys.},

We show that the character of chemical bonding is essential in the solute\&ndash;GB interaction, and that formation of directed quasi-covalent bonds between Si and Zn solutes and neighboring Al atoms causes a significant reconstruction of the GB structure involving a GB shear-migration coupling. For the solutes that are acceptors of electrons in the Al matrix and have a bigger atomic size (such as Mg), the preferred position is determined by the presence of extra volume at the GB and/or reduced number of the nearest neighbors; in this case, the symmetric GB keeps its structure. By using MD/MC approach, we found that GBs undergo significant structural reconstruction during segregation, which can involve the formation of single- or double-layer segregations, GB splitting, and coupled shear-migration, depending on the details of interatomic interactions.},

The results of these full-field calculations are assessed using the time dependent evolution of the following criteria: grain size, grain number, total interface energy, grain boundary disorientation distribution, grain boundary energy distribution and number of neighboring grains distribution. Of particular interest is the relationship between the grain boundary energy function and the evolution of the grain boundary network in the sense of both its morphology and its constitution. Some notable results are that the disorientation distribution evolution is inversely correlated to the grain boundary energy function itself and that the kinetics of grain growth are heavily effected by the heterogeneity of the system.},

	abstract = {The grain boundary network (GBN) was controlled by grain boundary engineering (GBE) in a 304 stainless steel. The total length proportion of Σ3n coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries was increased to more than 70\% associating with the formation of large size highly twinned grain-cluster microstructure. Only coherent twin boundaries (Σ3c) were found to be resistant to intergranular corrosion (IGC) and only such boundaries could be termed “special” ones. The improvement of resistance to IGC of the GBE specimen can be attributed to the large size grain-clusters associated with high proportion of the Σ3n boundaries and the interconnected Σ3n-type triple junctions.},

            Ni-based fcc alloys are frequently used as critical structural materials in nuclear energy applications. Despite extensive studies, fundamental questions remain regarding point defect migration and solute segregation as a function of grain boundary character after irradiation. In this study, a coupled experimental and modeling approach is used to understand the response of grain boundary character in a model Ni–5Cr alloy after high temperature heavy-ion irradiation. Radiation-induced segregation and void denuded zones were experimentally examined as a function of grain boundary character, while a kinetic rate theory model with grain boundary character boundary conditions was used to theoretically model Cr depletion in the alloy system. The results highlight major variations in the radiation response between the coherent and incoherent twin grain boundaries, but show limited disparity in defect sink strength between random low- and high-angle grain boundary regimes.},

	abstract = {In this study, ab initio molecular dynamics, implemented via density functional theory, is used to simulate self-interstitial diffusion in pure Ni and in the Ni-18 at.\% Cr model alloy. Interstitial tracer diffusivities are measured from simulation results for pure Ni and for both Ni and Cr in the Ni–18Cr alloy. An Arrhenius function ﬁt to these tracer diffusivities is then used in a rate theory model for radiation induced segregation, along with the experimentally measured vacancy diffusivities. It is predicted that interstitial diffusion has a tendency to cause Cr enrichment near grain boundaries, partially counterbalancing the tendency for vacancy diffusion to cause Cr depletion. This results in more mild Cr depletion than would result if only the vacancy diffusion were accounted for, in better agreement with experiment. This physical description of RIS in Ni–Cr alloys, which invokes the effects of both vacancy and interstitial diffusion, is distinct from the conventional description which accounts only for the effect of vacancy diffusion.},
